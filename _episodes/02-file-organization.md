#### Face it...

- There are going to be files
- LOTS of files
- The files will change over time
- The files will have relationships to each other
- It'll probably get complicated

***
#### Mighty weapon

- File organization and naming is a mighty weapon against chaos
- Make a file's name and location VERY INFORMATIVE about what it is, why it exists, how it relates to other things
- The more things are self-explanatory, the better
- `READMEs` are great, but don't document something if you could just make that thing self-documenting by definition

### Organizing your data analysis workflow

#### Raw data $\rightarrow$ data

Pick a strategy, any strategy, just pick one and *stick to it*!

***
#### Data $\rightarrow$ results

Pick a strategy, any strategy, just pick one and *stick to it*!

#### Data $\rightarrow$ results

### A real (and imperfect!) example

#### Data

Ready to analyze data:

Raw data:

***
#### Analysis and figures

`R` scripts + the `Markdown` files from "Compile Notebook":

***
The figures created in those `R` scripts and linked in those `Markdown` files:

***
#### Scripts
Linear progression of `R` scripts, and `Makefile` to run the entire analysis:

***
#### Results

Tab-delimited files with one row per gene of parameter estimates, test statistics, etc.:

***
#### Expository files

Files to help collaborators understand the model we fit: some markdown docs, a Keynote presentation, Keynote slides exported as PNGs for viewability on GitHub:

#### Caveats / problems with this example

- This project is no where near done, i.e. no manuscript or publication-ready figs.
- File naming has inconsistencies due to three different people being involved.
- Code and reports/figures all sit together because it’s just much easier that way w/ `knitr` & `RMarkdown`.

***
#### Wins of this example

- I can walk away from the project and come back to it a year later and resume work fairly quickly
- The two other people (the post-doc whose project it is + the bioinformatician for that lab) were able to figure out what I did and decide which files they needed to look at, etc.

GOOD ENOUGH!

### Other tips

#### Tips: the `from_joe` directory

- Let's say my collaborator and data producer is Joe.
- He will send me data with weird space-containing file names, data in Microsoft Excel workbooks, etc.
- It is futile to fight this, just quarantine all the crazy here. I rename things and/or export to plain text and put those files in my data directory.
- Whether I move, copy, or symlink depends on the situation.
- Whatever I did gets recorded in a `README` or in comments in my `R` code -- whatever makes it easiest for me to remind myself of a file's provenance, if it came from the outside world in a state that was not ready for programmatic analysis.

***
#### Tip: give yourself less rope

- I often revoke my own write permission to the raw data file.
- Then I can't accidentally edit it.
- It also makes it harder to do manual edits in a moment of weakness, when you know you should just add a line to your data cleaning script.

***
#### Tip: prose

- Sometimes you need a place to park key emails, internal documentation and explanations, random Word and PowerPoint docs people send, etc.
- This is kind of like `from_joe`, where I don’t force myself to keep same standards with respect to file names and open formats.

***
#### Tip: life cycle of data

Here’s how most data analyses go down in reality:
- You get raw data
- You explore, describe and visualize it
- You diagnose what this data needs to become useful
- You fix, clean, marshal the data into ready-to-analyze form
- You visualize it some more
- You fit a model or whatever and write lots of numerical results to file
- You make prettier tables and many figures based on the data & results accumulated by this point
- Both the data file(s) and the code/scripts that acts on them reflect this progression

***
#### Prepare data $\rightarrow$ Do stats $\rightarrow$ Make tables & figs

The `R` scripts:

```
01_marshal-data.r
02_pre-dea-filtering.r
03_dea-with-limma-voom.r
04_explore-dea-results.r
90_limma-model-term-name-fiasco.r
```

The figures left behind:

### Recap

File organization should reflect inputs vs outputs and the flow of information
